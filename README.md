# CHOOSING THE BEST MODEL FROM THREE MODEL FITTED ON A DATASET

## PROBLEM

Using Logistic Regression,Decision Tree classifier and Random Forest Classifier to train a dank dataset and picking the model with highest accuracy_score as the best model.

## Solution

The dataset was firstly preprocessed , split into train and test set and then trained the dataset with the three classifier after which the accuracy_score of the three models were examined .The accuracy_score of Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier were almost the same but with the high recall value of Logistic Regression,It was picked to be the best model
